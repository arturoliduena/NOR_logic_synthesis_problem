## Combinatorial Problem Solving (CPS)
## Project: Logic Synthesis

---

## 1. Problem Description
In this project, we aim to synthesize circuits using NOR gates to implement Boolean functions. The goal is to minimize the depth of the circuit, with size as a secondary consideration. Given a truth table representing the desired function, the task is to find an optimal NOR-circuit.
